# Stage

Stage is a View-based Android UI framework. It helps you create an app with only one Activity. It learns a lot from [Conductor](https://github.com/bluelinelabs/Conductor).

## Structure

![Stage Structure](images/stage-structure.jpg)

Name | Description
---|---
__Director__ | Director can be hired by Activity or Scene. A Director can direct multiple Stages.
__Stage__ | A Stage holds a Scene stack.
__Scene__ | A Scene is a View wrapper with lifecycle.
__Curtain__ | Curtain show transition between Scenes.

## Scene Lifecycle

![Scene Lifecycle](images/scene-lifecycle.jpg)

Activity lifecycle is integrated to Scene lifecycle. If Activity.onPause() is called, Scene.onPause() is called on all resumed Scenes. If Activity.onStop() is called, Scene.onStop() is called on all started Scenes.

Scene instances are kept after Activity recreated. Instead of recreating Scene instances, onDestroyView() and onCreateView() are called.

## View attaching and detaching

Scene have a property named `Opacity` which describes how this Scene affects the visibility of the Scene just below.

Name | Description
---|---
__Transparent__|The Scene just below is visible
__Translucent__|The Scene just below is only visible if this Scene is the top Scene
__Opaque__|The Scene just below is invisible

For example, a dialog-like Scene is transparent, a swipe-to-finish Scene is translucent.

Stage handles Scene view attaching and detaching according to Scenes' `Opacity`.
